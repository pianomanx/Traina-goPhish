# Introducing the "Morning Catch" scenario

![Morning Catch](http://imgur.com/ntxL0KB.png)

For this documentation, we will step through the process of setting up users, templates, and a full campaign from scratch for a fake company called Morning Catch. In this case, we are assuming the role of a security administrator of Morning Catch and have been given the authorization to perform this training.

As a note, this fake company is based on a great VM used specifically for testing phishing frameworks that you can download [here](http://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2014/08/06/introducing-morning-catch-a-phishing-paradise/) if you're interested.

The fake company will consist of 3 users: Richard Bourne, Boyd Jenius, and Haiti Moreo.
